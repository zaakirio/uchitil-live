# Contributing to Uchitil Live

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Uchitil Live! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this project.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production branch
- `devtest` - Development and testing branch
- Feature branches should be created from `devtest`

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/uchitil-live.git
   ```
3. Add the original repository as upstream:
   ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/zaakirio/uchitil-live.git
   ```
4. Create a new branch from `devtest`:
   ```bash
   git checkout devtest
   git pull upstream devtest
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Development Process

1. Always start your work from the `devtest` branch
2. Create a new branch for each feature/fix
3. Make your changes
4. Write or update tests as needed
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Update documentation if necessary

### Issue Creation

Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix:

1. Check if an issue already exists
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear title
   - Detailed description
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected behavior
   - Screenshots (if applicable)
   - Labels (bug, enhancement, etc.)

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a PR from your feature branch to `devtest`
2. Link the PR to the related issue using the issue number (e.g., "Fixes #123")
3. Fill out the PR template completely
4. Ensure CI checks pass
5. Request review from at least one maintainer
6. Address any review comments
7. Once approved, the PR will be merged into `devtest`
