# Uchitil Live Privacy Policy

*Last updated: [Current Date]*

## Our Privacy-First Commitment

Uchitil Live is built on the principle that your session data should remain private and under your control. This privacy policy explains how we handle data in our open-source session recorder.

## Data Processing Philosophy

### Local-First Processing
- **Session transcription**: Processed entirely on your device using local Whisper models
- **Audio recordings**: Never transmitted to external servers
- **Session content**: Remains on your infrastructure
- **AI summaries**: Generated locally or through your chosen LLM provider

### Your Data Ownership
- You own all session data, transcripts, and recordings
- Data is stored locally on your device
- No vendor lock-in - export your data anytime
- Complete control over data retention and deletion

## Usage Analytics

### What We Collect
To improve Uchitil Live and ensure optimal performance, we collect minimal, anonymized usage data:

**Application Usage:**
- Feature usage patterns (which tools you use most)
- Session duration and frequency
- Performance metrics (transcription success rates, error frequencies)
- UI interaction patterns (button clicks, navigation flows)

**Technical Metrics:**
- Application version and platform information
- Error logs and crash reports (anonymized)
- Performance benchmarks (processing times, resource usage)

### What We DON'T Collect
We never collect:
- ❌ Session content, transcripts, or recordings
- ❌ Personal information or identifiable data
- ❌ File names, session titles, or metadata
- ❌ Audio data or voice patterns
- ❌ Participant names or contact information
- ❌ LLM conversations or AI-generated content

### Why We Collect This Data
This analytics collection is necessary for:
- **Product Quality**: Identifying and fixing bugs that impact user experience
- **Performance Optimization**: Understanding resource usage and system bottlenecks
- **Security**: Detecting potential security issues and vulnerabilities
- **Feature Development**: Making data-driven decisions about new features
- **Open Source Sustainability**: Ensuring the project meets user needs effectively

### Analytics Implementation
