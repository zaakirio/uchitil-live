# System Architecture

Uchitil Live is a self-contained desktop application built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). It combines a Rust-based backend with a Next.js frontend into a single, efficient, and cross-platform application.

## Component Details

### Frontend (Next.js)

*   Provides the user interface for managing sessions, displaying transcriptions, and configuring the application.
*   Communicates with the Rust core through Tauri's command system.

### Backend (Rust Core)

*   **Tauri Core:** The heart of the application, responsible for managing the window, handling events, and exposing the Rust core to the frontend.
*   **Audio Engine:** Captures audio from the microphone and system, processes it, and prepares it for transcription.
*   **Transcription Engine:** Uses local speech-to-text models (Whisper or Parakeet) to transcribe the captured audio. It can be accelerated with a GPU.
*   **Database:** A local SQLite database that stores session metadata, transcripts, and summaries.
*   **Summary Engine:** Generates session summaries using various Large Language Models (LLMs), including local models via Ollama.
