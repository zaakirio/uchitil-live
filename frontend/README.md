    git clone https://github.com/zaakirio/uchitil-live
    cd uchitil-live/frontend
   ```
  

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### For Windows:

1. Install prerequisites:
   - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
   - Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
   - Install pnpm: `npm install -g pnpm`
   - Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with C++ development tools

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/zaakirio/uchitil-live
    cd uchitil-live/frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   pnpm install
   ```

## Running the App

### For macOS:

Use the provided script to run the app in development mode:
```bash
./clean_run.sh
```

To build a production version:
```bash
./clean_build.sh
```

You can specify the log level (info, debug, trace):
```bash
./clean_run.sh debug
```

### For Windows:

Use the provided script to run the app in development mode:
```cmd
clean_run_windows.bat
```

To build a production version:
```cmd
clean_build_windows.bat
```

## Whisper Transcription Server

The application includes a pre-built Whisper server for real-time speech recognition:

- Located in `whisper-server-package/`
- Supports speaker diarization
- Runs locally for privacy
- Uses Metal acceleration on macOS

To run the Whisper server manually:
```bash
cd whisper-server-package
./run-server.sh
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:8178

## Development

### Frontend (Next.js)
- The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- Source code is in the `src/` directory
- To run only the frontend: `pnpm run dev`

### Backend (Tauri)
- The Rust backend is in the `src-tauri/` directory
- Handles audio capture, file system access, and native integrations
- To run only the Tauri development server: `pnpm run tauri dev`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues on macOS
- If you encounter permission issues with scripts, make them executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x clean_run.sh clean_build.sh whisper-server-package/run-server.sh
  ```
- For microphone access issues, ensure the app has microphone permissions in System Preferences
- If the Whisper server fails to start, check if port 8178 is already in use

### Common Issues on Windows
- If you encounter build errors, ensure Visual Studio Build Tools are properly installed
- For audio capture issues, check Windows privacy settings for microphone access
- If the app fails to start, try running Command Prompt as administrator
